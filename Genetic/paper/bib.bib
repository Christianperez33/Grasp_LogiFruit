  abstract = {The storage of goods plays a crucial role in warehouse management systems. Although this operation is often considered simple, it is in fact complex, due to the volume of products, the uncertainty in demands, and the rapid customer service response that the market requires. Moreover, the optimization of logistical resources to maintain an efficient operational flow, such as the allocation of storage spaces, often requires complex decisions. In this paper, we analyze academic contributions on the storage location assignment problem published between 2005 and 2017. The literature is classified according to the solution methods, objectives, and related considerations. Suggestions are also provided for future research.},

Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few literature reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly.

Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature. This classification is the first to categorize the articles to this level of detail.},

@article{Eksioglu2009,
  abstract  = {This paper presents a methodology for classifying the literature of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). VRP as a field of study and practice is defined quite broadly. It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP's domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP's facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this work we propose a hybrid algorithm for a class of Vehicle Routing Problems with homogeneous fleet. A sequence of Set Partitioning (SP) models, with columns corresponding to routes found by a metaheuristic approach, are solved, not necessarily to optimality, using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver, that may interact with the metaheuristic during its execution. Moreover, we developed a reactive mechanism that dynamically controls the dimension of the SP models when dealing with large size instances. The algorithm was extensively tested on benchmark instances of the following Vechicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants: (i) Capacitated VRP; (ii) Asymmetric VRP; (iii) Open VRP; (iv) VRP with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery; (v) VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery; (vi) Multi-depot VRP; (vii) Multi-depot VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery. The results obtained were quite competitive with those found by heuristics devoted to specific variants. A number of new best solutions were obtained.},

  abstract = {We investigate the open vehicle routing problem with uncertain demands, where the vehicles do not necessarily return to their original locations after delivering goods to customers. We firstly describe the customer's demand as specific bounded uncertainty sets with expected demand value and nominal value, and propose the robust optimization model that aim at minimizing transportation costs and unsatisfied demands in the specific bounded uncertainty sets. We propose four robust strategies to cope with the uncertain demand and an improved differential evolution algorithm (IDE) to solve the robust optimization model. Then we analyze the performance of four different robust strategies by considering the extra costs and unmet demand. Finally, the computational experiments indicate that the robust optimization greatly avoid unmet demand while incurring a small extra cost and the optimal return strategy is the best strategy by balancing the trade-off the cost and unmet demand among different robust strategies.},

We present a heuristic improvement procedure for OVRP based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques. Given an initial feasible solution to be possibly improved, the method follows a destruct-and-repair paradigm, where the given solution is randomly destroyed (i.e., customers are removed in a random way) and repaired by solving an ILP model, in the attempt of finding a new improved feasible solution. The overall procedure can be considered as a general framework which could be extended to cover other variants of Vehicle Routing Problems. We report computational results on benchmark instances from the literature. In several cases, the proposed algorithm is able to find the new best known solution for the considered instances.},

In this paper, we address this problem and introduce an adaptive evolutionary approach that uses a genetic algorithm in an adaptive process.

We compare the adaptive version of a hybrid genetic algorithm with the non-adaptive one with respect to the robustness and the quality of the generated solutions. The results obtained show the ability of our operator combination adaptation approach to produce solutions that are superior to hand-tuning and other adaptive methods with respect to performance sensitivity and robustness.},
